IRC7 version 2.0 brought a completely redesigned "New connection" dialog. The previous dialog started getting clumsy with all the settings like SASL and SSL and in the version 2.0 the dialog was actually removed completely and instead there's a new page dedicated for creating a new IRC connection:

The new page also offers a connection history.  It stores all the previously opened connections and allows you to easily to reconnect to the server.

The version 2.2 has also been released (sorry, no 2.1 :) and that contained some tweaks to the server connection dialog. Also the built-in web browser should now behave better.
