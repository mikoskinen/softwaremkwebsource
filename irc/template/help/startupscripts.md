IRC Bots and other network services (like Q in QuakeNet) often require authentication before the functionalities of the service can be used. The authentication usually happens by sending a private message to the service. Typing and sending this message every time manually is cumbersome and to help with these regularly performed tasks, the IRC7 1.3 added a script box. In this script box the user can add one or many commands which are automatically send to the server when the connection to the server has been opened.

To access the script box, first open a connection to the IRC-server, then from the server console bring up the application bar and select “configure startup”.
